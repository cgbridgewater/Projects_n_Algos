// Weekend Challenge
// This weekend, complete the “Date, on a Deserted Island” problem series, if you have not yet done so.

 

// Then, if time allows, incorporate the Math library into a new quiz game. See if users can memorize 10 digits of Pi. Do the same for the constant e, the square root of 2, as well as the square root of 1/2. These values are all available in the Math library. What other Math functions or properties can you incorporate? Continue to use prompt, and output the game statistics when the user quits.
