// Weekend Challenge
// For this weekend challenge, consider the game Tic-Tac-Toe. How would you represent a 3x3 game board: specifically, whether each square is unoccupied or claimed by a player? Could you represent this with an array? What would the array contain? Is there a benefit from having an array of arrays?

// Once you have a good design in mind, create a function that, given one of these gameboards, automatically determines and returns the overall state of the game. A game is always in one of five different states – one state might be “Player 1’s turn”; another might be “Game over: player 2 has won.”

// Once you have mastered that, can you extend this function to handle gameboards of arbitrary size?
