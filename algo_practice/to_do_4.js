// To Do 4


// Extract-o-matic
// Create the extractDigit(num,digitNum) function that given a number and a digit number, returns the numeral value of that digit. 0 represents the ones digit, 1 represents the tens digit, etc. Given (1824,2), return 8. Given (1824,0), return 4. Given (1824,7), return 0.

// Second: handle negative digitNum values, where -1 represents tenths digit (0.x), -2 represents hundredths digit (0.0x), etc. Given (123.45,-1), return 4.

// Third: handle negative num values as well, doing what you think is appropriate.



// Most Significant Digit
// If you already know who Ada Lovelace is, that’s great! In a History of Science, she is significant. Given a number of any size, return the most significant digit. If you already know what strings are, that’s great! However, don’t use them here :-). 

// Hint: use WHILE to bring the most significant digit into a range where you can use the friendly modulus operator (%). The most significant digit is the leftmost non-zero digit of a number. Given 12345, return 1. Given 67.89, return 6. Given 0.00987, return 9.

// Second: handle negative num values as well, doing what you think is appropriate.
